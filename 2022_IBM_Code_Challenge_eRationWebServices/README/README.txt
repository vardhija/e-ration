PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================
Two-thirds of people in India live in poverty: 68.8% of the Indian population lives on less than $2 a day. Over 30% even have less than $1.25 per day available - they are considered extremely poor. It is apparent that their earnings are not enough for their daily existence. This is one of the main reasons that the State Governments have come up with the idea of food supplies for the their needy citizens. These foods are distributed raw to the citizens from centres such as “Ration Shops” or “Fair Price Shops” physically. Thus there are instances of corruptions and inadequate supply of food.
This is where an online system for allocating foods comes into the picture. Here, we present you a simple prototype of a web application where the citizens can directly know their allocated ration items and either accept the needed items or send it back to the government to avoid food wastage.

PERSONAS OF THE SYSTEM
======================

ACTOR 1- THE GOVERNMENT: This is the user with admin previllages. The user details of this user are hardcoded into the database. Hence no other admin creation is possible.

Use Cases:-
>> Approve users
>> Allot rations
>> Send Notifications to Citizens
>> CRUD Items, Notifications & Users
>> View Orders

ACTOR 2- THE CITIZEN: This is the benificiary user who uses the app to avail the ration services.

Use Cases:-
>> See Allotment
>> Select from allotment
>> Donate unselected from alloted items
>> View notifications
>> Checkout

ARCHETECTURE
============
Frontend part is handled by the ReactJs and the backend part is handled by ExpressJs, NodeJS and MongoDB. Most of the modern web applications follow the various architectural patterns to make powerful web applications. We follow one of the most used and famous architectural patterns, MVC. MVC is an acronym is Model, View, and Controller. These three blocks of MVC represent the interconnectivity and the logical data flow inside of the web applications. MERN stack strictly follows this architectural pattern.
